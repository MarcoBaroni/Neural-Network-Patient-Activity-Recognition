The folder Baroni_Marco_Final_Datasets contains the final output of the two preprocessing functions.

Baroni_Marco_NNaDL_report is the .pdf file with the report.

Baroni_Marco_NNaDL_CNN .ipynb file is the jupyter notebook in with the model definition, the random search, the training and the testing.

Baroni_Marco_NNaDL_ImagesLabelsExtraction .ipynb is the jupyter notebook in which the raw data are extracted fromt eh downloaded data.

Baroni_Marco_NNaDL_DatasetReforge .ipynb is the jupter notebook in which we further continue the preprocessing and taht outputs the files into the Baroni_Marco_Final_Datasets folder.


Please if someone wants to try everything it could to change the paths to upload the data in Baroni_Marco_NNaDL_CNN.ipynb and maybe to change the output path to save the .t files in Baroni_Marco_NNaDL_DatasetReforge.ipynb
